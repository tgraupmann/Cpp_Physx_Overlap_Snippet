# Overview

This sample project is a Windows C++ Console App that demonstrates using PhysX to do an overlap query with boxes.

```c++
// The code creates a static cube and performs an overlap query with a box geometry.
// The code prints the names of the overlapping actors if any overlap is detected.
// The code can be used as a reference to perform overlap queries in PhysX.
```
